Adding a password generator which meets all of it's requirements.

### Challenge
A company has given me a objective to demonstrate my skills by adding a password generator. 

### User Story

SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
 
### Aceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password

THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt

## My Process/### What I learned
I have watched many YouTube videos, searched on W3 schools website and re-watched my class lectures to help me implement my coding to provide a password generator.  
I have seen different password generators online to see how each coding is unique and taught me how each code functions.
